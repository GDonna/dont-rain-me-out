# Don't Rain on Me!
Class Project NU Bootcamp

This is our first collaberative group project for NU's Coding Bootcamp 2023. We wanted to create a webpage that will help users find events for based on a location search. From this location search, it will pull up all the event details, including the next dates, events, venues, images and the weather.

The whole premise for our project is to make it easier for users to be able to see if the weather on that particular date of events that they may potentially want to go- hence the title "Don't Rain On Me!" This webpage is ideal for anyone who likes to be prepared to bring either a pancho or sunscreen, and is absolutely tired of being rained on for outdoor activities!

## Developer Notes

This is a webpage in collaboration with Stephen Hogue, Marko Andreev, and Donna Goon. Technologies used in this project includes Tailwind CSS, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, HTML, Ticketmaster API, Tomorrow (Forecast) API, and VS Code. 

Roles were broken down as follows:

```
Donna Goon: Homepage creation, Stylizing, README, Modal Creation(in lieu of alerts/prompts)
Stephen Hogue: Event Card- Main Page creation, Ticketmaster API Pulls, Stylizing 
Marko Andreev: Event Card- Page (Weather), Tommorrow API Pulls, Stylizing

```

## User Story

As a user, I want to search venues. 
When I search a venue, it will pull up event details and the weather for that location. 
Then I will be able to view ticket availibility for that event. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```
When a user enters a venue,
Then it will direct user to a new page.
Then it will pull up events details for the venue.
It will only show top 5 events for that venue. 
When the event details populate for the venue,
Then it will pull weather details for the venue.
When a user enters in a bad value for venue,
Then it will return to homepage.
When the user is able to see the event details and the weather forcast for that event,
Then the user is able to see ticket availbility.
When the user clicks on the ticket availibility,
Then it will show a link to ticketmaster's page
```
